# NativescriptDictionary

Dictionary app built in Nativescript

## User guide

The app was built with minimalistic UI in mind,
so the input field and buttons are reusable across different actions.

UI components:
  - input field
  - compose button
  - toggle button

On app start enter in the input field the absolute path to the text
file that you wish to open and click on the compose button.

Toggle button is for toggling highlighted words.

Single tap on line highlights the line.

Double tap on line deletes the line.

Long press on line copies that line's content and the app then asks you to enter
line number to which you want to copy it.

Creating a new dictionary entry is done by clicking on compose button, then
entering the contents of your new definition into input field and finally
clicking on the line after which you want to insert the new definition.
If you changed your mind and wish to cancel inserting new definition,
click on the compose button again.
